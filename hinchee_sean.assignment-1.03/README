A simple dungeon generator implementing Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate a path from an arbitrary distant point in the dungeon to the player. The player is placed at a pseudo-random location within a pseudo-random room in the dungeon. The dungeon prints all three views of the dungeon: non-tunneling, tunneling, and normal views. The binary heap provided by Dr. Sheaffer is used as the binary heap leveraged by Dijkstra's algorithm. The heap is only interacted with to initiate, insert, remove, and destroy. Available options are --load to load from a file, --save to save to a file, and -f to specify a filename other than the default "dungeon." The -f flag will affect both --load and --save if utilized at the same time. Further flags may be added in the future.
