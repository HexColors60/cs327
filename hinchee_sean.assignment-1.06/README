A straightforward dungeon generator that utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm for pathing of specific monsters and pseudo-random room and monster generation. Stairs are present which can be activated by invoking the matching symbol as the stairwell, '<' for up and '>' for down. Monsters are indexed and can be viewed by utilizing the 'm' key. Source is structured between C and C++ with a bridged gap between the two languages such that the source is split into either C or C++ based filed, but can interconnect and intercommunicate.
