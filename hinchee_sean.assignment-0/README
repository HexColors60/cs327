This Langton's ants implementation, as per the spec, avoids adjusting the global variables and has hardcoded the 128 value for the grid buffer such that no global is added for use in the buffer instantiation. A limited for loop runs at the core with a number of iterations aimed at producing output that includes a "leg" as per a citation found on http://mathworld.wolfram.com/LangtonsAnt.html that cites an image with the "leg"/"highway" requiring 10647 steps. Frame skip is set to 5 for sanity purposes. A series of if/else statements are utilized to provide directional support where 1 is North, 0 is East, 3 is South, and 2 is West. The directional system was inspired by a tip from Ryan Krause (roommate/ex-327 TA) that modulus could be utilized for simplified rotational movement after mentioning the original design which was based on a 360 degree axis (overcomplicated).
